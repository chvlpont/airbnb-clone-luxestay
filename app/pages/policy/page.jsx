              You must ensure that the property is clean, well-maintained, and
              in good working order prior to each guest's arrival. Specifically:
              The interior and exterior of the property should be presented in a
              condition that meets or exceeds the expectations set by the
              listing. Broken appliances, malfunctioning amenities, or unsafe
              conditions should be addressed immediately. Any issues that arise
              during a guestâ€™s stay should be addressed promptly. As a host, you
              should either be available to respond to guest concerns or provide
              contact information for a local representative who can assist with
              emergencies or repairs.
